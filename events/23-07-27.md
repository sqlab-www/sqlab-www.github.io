### 概要：
Rust is a modern systems language focused on performance and
reliability. Complementing Rust's promise to provide "fearless
concurrency", developers frequently exploit asynchronous message
passing. Unfortunately, sending and receiving messages in an arbitrary
order to maximise computation-communication overlap (a popular
optimisation in message-passing applications) opens up a Pandora's box
of subtle concurrency bugs.
To guarantee deadlock-freedom by construction, we present Rumpsteak: a
new Rust framework based on multiparty session types. Previous session
type implementations in Rust are either built upon synchronous and
blocking communication and/or are limited to two-party interactions.
Crucially, none support the arbitrary ordering of messages for
efficiency.
Rumpsteak instead targets asynchronous async/await code. Its unique
ability is allowing developers to arbitrarily order send/receive
messages while preserving deadlock-freedom. For this, Rumpsteak
incorporates two recent advanced session type theories: (1)
k-multiparty compatibility (k-MC), which globally verifies the safety
of a set of participants, and (2) asynchronous multiparty session
subtyping, which locally verifies optimisations in the context of a
single participant.
